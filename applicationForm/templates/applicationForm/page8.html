                <p style="text-align:justify">Applicants have to support their complaints by documentary evidence. This
                    means that if
                    there is a
                    complaint about an official act or decision, a copy of that decision or document attesting to that
                    official act or measure must be provided. The Court cannot just take the word of applicants for what
                    they say has happened. So, if an applicant complains that his house is being expropriated, he must
                    attach to the application form a copy of the official decision ordering the expropriation; if an
                    applicant alleges that she has been refused legal aid for her child custody proceedings, she must
                    provide a copy of the document by the decision body setting out that refusal. If there are a number
                    of documents relating to a particular incident or procedure, an applicant should err on the side of
                    caution and provide all that appear relevant. <br><br>
                    If you are unable to obtain a copy of a decision or document, you should explain this in the
                    application form. But you must show that it was practically impossible for you to obtain the
                    document: applicants are expected to take reasonable steps to apply to authorities for copies of
                    documents and to comply with reasonable formalities in that respect. If the explanation is not
                    forthcoming or adequate, the application will not be allocated to a judicial formation. <br><br>
                    Where documents are provided by electronic means, they must be in the format required by this
                    practice direction; they must also be arranged and numbered in accordance with the list of documents
                    on the application form.
